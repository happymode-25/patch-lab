"""Prove the selftest and the e2e suite can actually fail, rather than
asserting that they can.

A green suite is not evidence of anything on its own: it is equally consistent
with "the code is correct" and with "the checks are not connected to the code".
The only way to tell those apart is to break the code on purpose and require
the suites to notice.

Three mutations, each checking something different:

  1. A behaviour change in the model. The daily recovery term is perturbed to
     drift 1%, so the closed-form anchor stops matching. If the selftest and
     the e2e suite are genuinely wired to the math, checks about the daily
     map and the compare gate stop passing.
  2. A check failure with no code change. If a failing check does not produce a
     non-zero exit, mutation 1 would have "passed" for the wrong reason.
  3. A restore check, because a harness that leaves the tree broken proves
     nothing about the next run.

Mutations must fail *as checks*, not as crashes. A SyntaxError also exits
non-zero, so a bare exit-code assertion would be satisfied by a file too broken
to run. The output is required to name a failing check.
