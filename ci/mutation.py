"""Mutation sweep for patch-lab, run against a SCRATCH COPY.

Why a scratch copy
------------------
The first version of the egress-broker harness rewrote the tool in place, in
the working tree. A sweep that dies halfway leaves a mutant sitting in the repo
looking like a legitimate commit. So the live repo is hashed before and after,
every mutation is applied to a throwaway copy, and the harness refuses to start
if it cannot make one.

Why a canary
------------
A sweep that reports "11/11 killed" is exactly what a broken harness reports.
The canary below is a provably semantically identical mutation (x and x * 1.0
cannot differ) and it MUST survive. If it is reported as killed, the verdict
for every other mutant in the run is worthless and the run is void.

Lessons encoded here, each one bought with a false result:
  * `with` on every write; an unflushed buffer made a mutant that never ran.
  * the written file is re-read from disk and compared before it is trusted.
  * py_compile must succeed or the run is discarded.
  * __pycache__ is purged around every run, or a stale .pyc masks the change.
  * selftest failures are read from STDOUT (`_expect` prints there).
  * the suite is asserted green before the sweep and again after the revert.
  * the e2e test COUNT is read from `Ran N tests`. `unittest` exits 0 when it
    collects nothing, so a mutant that stopped collection looks like a pass.
  * a mutation that makes the tool *refuse to run* (fail-closed exit) is not a
    killed check; mutants are chosen so the suites report a named failure.

Usage:
  python ci/mutation.py                    # full sweep
  python ci/mutation.py models compare     # only these groups
  python ci/mutation.py CANARY             # prove the harness can see a survivor

Run it from the repo root. It never writes to the working tree.
